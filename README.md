# React + Vite Project

This project is a modern web application built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It features a modular structure, hot module replacement, and a clean development workflow. The app appears to be focused on document management, authority/stakeholder workflows, and interactive mapping, likely for administrative or project management purposes.
